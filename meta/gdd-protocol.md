# Game Design Document Protocol

If `game-design.md` exists:
- Follow strictly; do not contradict.
- Ask before changing gameplay; update doc if approved.

If missing:
- Ask for: genre, core loop, player abilities, enemies, systems, platforms, 2D/3D, UI expectations.
- After clarification: create initial `game-design.md`, project structure, and architecture.

Rule:
- Do not invent gameplay without explicit request.
