# Git & Commit Protocol

Responsibilities:
- Group changes; prepare commit titles/descriptions; update memory docs first.

Grouping:
- Separate by feature/fix/refactor/tooling/meta.
- Each commit compiles; coherent; no unrelated mixing.

Message style:
- Present tense; ≤ 72 chars; descriptive.
- Body explains why, not just what.

Pre-commit updates:
- Update `SESSION_MEMORY.md`, `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (if choices), `fast-tools.md` (if tools), `game-design.md` (if gameplay changed).
